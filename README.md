#  CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my **CSES problem set** solutions in **C++**.

Each folder corresponds to a CSES category, and each file contains a **fully working, commented** solution.

##  Structure
- **Introductory Problems** — Basic logic, loops, and implementation.
- **Sorting and Searching** — Greedy, binary search, and prefix sums.
- **Dynamic Programming** — Classic DP transitions and state definitions.
- **Graph Algorithms** — BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.
- **Range Queries** — Fenwick tree, segment tree.
- **Tree Algorithms** — DFS on trees, LCA, subtree sums. --Done

##  My Goal
To complete the entire **CSES problem set**, focusing on:
- Writing clean and efficient C++ code
- Understanding state transitions deeply
- Optimizing memory and runtime for each problem

##  Language
All solutions are written in:
- C++ 17
